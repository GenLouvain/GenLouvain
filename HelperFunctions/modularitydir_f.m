function [B,twom] = modularitydir_f(A,gamma)
% MODULARITYDIR_F returns monolayer Leicht-Newman modularity matrix for directed network given by adjacency matrix A, function handle version
%
% Version: 2.1.2
% Date: Tue Nov 28 14:20:20 EST 2017
% 
%
%   Input: A:  NxN adjacency matrices of a directed network
%          gamma: resolution parameter
%
%   Output: B: function handle where B(i) returns the ith column of 
%          [N]x[N] modularity matrix of the monolayer network 
%           with adjacency matrix A
%           twom: normalisation constant
%
%   Example of usage: [B,twom]=modularitydir_f(A,gamma);
%          [S,Q]= genlouvain(B); 
%          Q=Q/twom;
%   Notes:
%     The matrix A is assumed to be square. This assumption is not checked 
%     here.
%
%     For smaller systems, it is potentially more efficient (and easier) to
%     directly use the sparse quality/modularity matrix B in MODULARITY. For
%     large systems with undirected networks, use MODULARITY_F.
%
%     This code serves as a template and can be modified for situations
%     with other wrinkles (e.g., different null models).  
%
%     By using this code, the user implicitly acknowledges that the authors
%     accept no liability associated with that use.  (What are you doing
%     with it anyway that might cause there to be a potential liability?!?)
