% pers = ORDINAL_PERSISTENCE(S) with a single multilayer partition or a 
% cell of multilayer partitions S (with S{i} the ith multilayer partition
% of cell S) computes the "persistence" of ordered multilayer partitions. The 
% output pers is a vector such that pers(i) is the persistence of multilayer 
% partition S{i} (stored as an N*T matrix where N is the number of nodes in 
% each layer and T is the number of layers). For a multilayer partition with 
% ordered layers, the value of persistence is the number of nodes that do 
% not change community assignments between consecutive layers (see Bazzi 
% et al. 2016 for more detail). Ordinal persistence varies between 0 and 1.
% Ordinal persistence is related to the multilayer quality function 
% developed in Mucha et al. 2010 when one uses ordinal interlayer coupling.
