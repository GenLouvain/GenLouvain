%GENLOUVAIN  Louvain-like community detection, specified quality function.

% Version: 2.1.2

%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B) with matrix B implements a Louvain-like greedy
%   community detection method using the modularity/quality matrix B that
%   encodes the quality function Q, defined by summing over all elements
%   B(i,j) such that nodes i and j are placed in the same community.
%   Following Blondel et al. 2008, the algorithm proceeds in two phases
%   repeated iteratively: quality is optimized by moving one node at a time
%   until no such moves improve quality; the communities found to that
%   point are then aggregated to build a new network where each node
%   represents a community.  The output vector S encodes the obtained
%   community assignments, with S(i) identifying the community to which
%   node i has been assigned.  The output Q gives the quality of the
%   resulting partition of the network.
%   NOTE: The matrix represented by B must be both symmetric and square.  
%   This condition is not checked thoroughly if B is a function handle, but 
%   is essential to the proper use of this routine. When B is a matrix, 
%   non-symmetric input is symmetrised (B=(B+B')/2), which preserves the
%   quality function.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B) with function handle B such that B(i) returns
%   the ith column of the modularity/quality matrix uses this function
%   handle (to reduce the memory footprint for large networks) until the
%   number of groups is less than 10000 and then builds the B matrix
%   corresponding to the new aggregated network in subsequent passes. Use
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit) to change this default=10000 limit.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,0) suppresses displayed text output.
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,0) forces index-ordered (cf.
%   randperm-ordered) consideration of nodes, for deterministic results
%   with randord = 'move'.
%
%   [S,Q]=GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,randord,randmove) controls additional
%   randomization to obtain a broader sample of the quality function
%   landscape. The possible values for 'randmove' are
%       'move': always move node under consideration to the community that 
%           results in maximal improvement in modularity (default)
%       'moverand': move the node under consideration to a community chosen
%           uniformly at random from all moves that increase the qualilty 
%           function
%       'moverandw': move the node under consideration to a community chosen
%           at random from all moves that increase the quality where the
%           probability of choosing a particular move is proportional to
%           its increase in the quality function
%       0: equivalent to 'move' (provided for backwards compatibility)
%       1: equivalent to 'moverand' (provided for backwards compatibility)
%
%   'moverand', and 'moverandw' mitigate some undesirable behavior for 
%   "multilayer" modularity with ordinal coupling ('moverandw' tends to be 
%   better behaved for large values of the interlayer coupling). With 
%   'move', the algorithm exhibits an abrupt change in behavior when the 
%   strength of the interlayer coupling approaches the maximum value of the
%   intralayer modularity matrices (see Bazzi et al. 2016 for more detail).
%
%   [S,Q] = GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,randord,randmove,S0) uses S0 as an
%   inital partition. The default choice for S0 is all singletons (
%   (and given by a length(B) by 1 vector). If a user specifies S0, it
%   needs to satisfy: numel(S0) = length(B). Note that the size of S will
%   match the size of S0. In a multilayer setting, a user may have to
%   reshape S appropriate (e.g., reshape(S,N,T), where N is the number of
%   nodes in each layer and T is the number of layers).
%
%   Example (using adjacency matrix A)
%         k = full(sum(A));
%         twom = sum(k);
%         B = @(v) A(:,v) - k'*k(v)/twom;
%         [S,Q] = genlouvain(B);
%         Q = Q/twom;
%     finds community assignments for the undirected network encoded by the
%     symmetric adjacency matrix A.  For small networks, one may obtain
%     reasonably efficient results even more simply by handling the full
%     modularity/quality matrix
%         B = A - k'*k/twom;
%     instead of the function handle.  Intended use also includes the
%     "multilayer" network quality function of Mucha et al. 2010, where B
%     encodes the interactions as an equivalent matrix (see examples posted
%     online at http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain).
%
%   Notes:
%
%     Under default options, this routine can return different results from
%     run to run because it considers nodes in pseudorandom (randperm)
%     order.  Because of the potentially large number of nearly-optimal
%     partitions (Good et al. 2010), one is encouraged to investigate
%     results of repeated applications of this code (and, if possible, of
%     other computational heuristics).  To force deterministic behavior with 
%     randord = 'move', ordering nodes by their index, pass zero as the 
%     fourth input: GENLOUVAIN(B,limit,verbose,0).
%
%     This algorithm is only "Louvain-like" in the sense that the two
%     phases are used iteratively in the same manner as in the Louvain
%     algorithm (Blondel et al. 2008).  Because it operates on a general
%     quality/modularity matrix B, it does not include any analytical
%     formulas for quickly identifying the change in modularity from a
%     proposed move nor any improved efficiency obtained by their use.  If
%     your problem uses one of the well-used null models included in other
%     codes, those codes should be much faster for your task.
%
%     Past versions had a problem where accumulated subtraction error might
%     lead to an infinite loop with each pass oscillating between two or
%     more partitions yet incorrectly identifying increases in quality.  We
%     believe this problem has been corrected by the relative change checks
%     in lines 178 and 269.  If you encounter a similar problem, notify
%     Peter Mucha (<a href="mailto:mucha@unc.edu">mucha@unc.edu</a>).
%
%     The output Q provides the sum over the appropriate elements of B
%     without any rescaling.  As such, we have rescaled Q in the example
%     above by 2m = sum(k) so that Q <= 1.
%
%     The '~' for ignoring function returns (used for "max" below) are not
%     supported prior to R2009b.  Replace (e.g. 'dummy') for pre-2009b.
%
%     By using this code, the user implicitly acknowledges that the authors
%     accept no liability associated with that use.  (What are you doing
%     with it anyway that might cause there to be a potential liability?!?)
